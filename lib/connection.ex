defmodule Connection do
  @moduledoc """
  A behaviour module for implementing connection processes.

  The `Connection` behaviour is a superset of the `GenServer` behaviour. The
  additional return values and callbacks are designed to aid building a
  connection process that can handle a peer being (temporarily) unavailable.

  An example `Connection` process:

      defmodule TCPConnection do

        use Connection

        def start_link(host, port, opts, timeout \\\\ 5000) do
          Connection.start_link(__MODULE__, {host, port, opts, timeout})
        end

        def send(conn, data), do: Connection.call(conn, {:send, data})

        def recv(conn, bytes, timeout \\\\ 3000) do
          Connection.call(conn, {:recv, bytes, timeout})
        end

        def close(conn), do: Connection.call(conn, :close)

        def init({host, port, opts, timeout}) do
          s = %{host: host, port: port, opts: opts, timeout: timeout, sock: nil}
          {:connect, :init, s}
        end

        def connect(_, %{sock: nil, host: host, port: port, opts: opts,
        timeout: timeout} = s) do
          case :gen_tcp.connect(host, port, [active: false] ++ opts, timeout) do
            {:ok, sock} ->
              {:ok, %{s | sock: sock}}
            {:error, _} ->
              {:backoff, 1000, s}
          end
        end

        def disconnect(info, %{sock: sock} = s) do
          :ok = :gen_tcp.close(sock)
          case info do
            {:close, from} ->
              Connection.reply(from, :ok)
            {:error, :closed} ->
              :error_logger.format("Connection closed~n", [])
            {:error, reason} ->
              reason = :inet.format_error(reason)
              :error_logger.format("Connection error: ~s~n", [reason])
          end
          {:connect, :reconnect, %{s | sock: nil}}
        end

        def handle_call(_, _, %{sock: nil} = s) do
          {:reply, {:error, :closed}, s}
        end

        def handle_call({:send, data}, _, %{sock: sock} = s) do
          case :gen_tcp.send(sock, data) do
            :ok ->
             {:reply, :ok, s}
            {:error, _} = error ->
              {:disconnect, error, error, s}
          end
        end
        def handle_call({:recv, bytes, timeout}, _, %{sock: sock} = s) do
          case :gen_tcp.recv(sock, bytes, timeout) do
            {:ok, _} = ok ->
              {:reply, ok, s}
            {:error, :timeout} = timeout ->
              {:reply, timeout, s}
            {:error, _} = error ->
              {:disconnect, error, error, s}
          end
        end
        def handle_call(:close, from, s) do
          {:disconnect, {:close, from}, s}
        end
      end

  The example above follows a common pattern. Try to connect immediately, if
  that fails backoff and retry after a delay. If a retry fails make another
  attempt after another delay. If the process disconnects a reconnection attempt
  is made immediately, if that fails backoff begins.

  Importantly when backing off requests will still be received by the process,
  which will need to be handled. In the above example the process replies with
  `{:error, :closed}` when it is disconnected.

  @behaviour :gen_server

  @doc """
  Called when the connection process is first started. `start_link/3` will block
  until it returns.

  Returning `{:ok, state}` will cause `start_link/3` to return
  `{:ok, pid}` and the process to enter its loop with state `state` without
  calling `connect/2`.

  This return value is useful when the process connects inside `init/1` so that
  `start_link/3` blocks until a connection is established.

  Returning `{:ok, state, timeout}` is similar to `{:ok, state}`
  except `handle_info(:timeout, state)` will be called after `timeout` if no
  message arrives.

  Returning `{:ok, state, :hibernate}` is similar to
  `{:ok, state}` except the process is hibernated awaiting a message.

  Returning `{:connect, info, state}` will cause `start_link/3` to return
  `{:ok, pid}` and `connect(info, state)` will be called immediately - even if
  messages are in the processes message queue. `state` contains the state of the
  process and `info` should contain any information not contained in the state
  that is needed to connect.

  This return value is very useful because connecting in `connect/2` will not
  block the parent process and a connection attempt is guaranteed to occur
  before any messages are handled, which is not possible when using a
  `GenServer`.

  Returning `{:backoff, timeout, state}` will cause `start_link/3` to return
  `{:ok, pid}` and the process to enter its normal loop with state `state`.
  `connect(:backoff, state)` is called after `timeout` if `connect/2` or
  `disconnect/2` is not called within the timeout.

  This return value can be used to delay or stagger the initial connection
  attempt.

  Returning `{:backoff, timeout, state, timeout2}` is similar to
  `{:backoff, timeout, state}` except `handle_info(:timeout, state)` will be
  called after `timeout2` if no message arrives.

  Returning `{:backoff, timeout, state, :hibernate}` is similar to
  `{:backoff, timeout, state}` except the process hibernates.

  Returning `:ignore` will cause `start_link/3` to return `:ignore` and the
  process will exit normally without entering the loop or calling
  `terminate/2`.

  Returning `{:stop, reason}` will cause `start_link/3` to return
  `{:error, reason}` and the process to exit with reason `reason` without
  entering the loop or calling `terminate/2`.

  Called when the process should try to connect. The first argument will either
  be the `info` term from `{:connect, info, state}` or
  `{:connect, info, reply, state}`, or `:backoff` if the connection attempt is
  triggered by backing off.

  It might be beneficial to do handshaking in this callback if connecting is
  successful.

  Returning `{:ok, state}` or `{:ok, state, timeout | :hibernate}` will cause
  the process to continue its loop. This should be returned when the connection
  attempt was successful. In the later case `handle_info(:timeout, state)` is
  called after `timeout` if no message has been received, if the third element
  is a timeout. Otherwise if the third element is `:hibernate` the process
  hibernates.

  Returning `{:backoff, timeout, state}` will cause the process to continue
  its loop but `connect(:backoff, state)` will be called after `timeout` if
  `connect/2` or `disconnect/2` is not called before that point.

  This return value is used when a connection attempt fails but another attempt
  should be made after a delay. It might be beneficial to increase the delay
  up to a maximum if successive attempts fail to prevent unnecessary work. If
  several connection processes are connecting to the same peer it may also be
  beneficial to add some jitter (randomness) to the delays. This spreads out the
  connection attempts and helps prevent many attempts occurring at the same time.

  Returning `{:backoff, timeout, state, timeout2 | :hibernate}` is similar to
  `{:backoff, timeout, state}` except `handle_info(:timeout, state)` is called
  after `timeout2` if no message has been received, or if `:hibernate`, the
  process hibernates.

  Returning `{:stop, reason, state}` will terminate the loop and call
  `terminate(reason, state)` before the process exits with reason `reason`.

  Returning `{:connect, info, state}` will call `connect(info, state)`
  immediately - even if there are messages in the message queue.

  Returning `{:backoff, timeout, state}` or
  `{:backoff, timeout, state, timeout2 | :hibernate}` starts a backoff timer and
  behaves the same as when returned from `connect/2`. See the `connect/2`
  callback for more information.

  Returning `{:noconnect, state}` or `{:noconnect, state, timeout | :hibernate}`
  will cause the process to continue is loop (and NOT call `connect/2` to
  try to reconnect). In the later case a timeout is started or the process
  hibernates.
